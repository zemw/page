This paper documents the permanent output loss due to financial crisis or politial turmoil.

**Data and measures**

- GDP: World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI); Penn World Tables
- Currency crisis measures: exchange market pressure index (currency depreciation + loss in foreign reserves)
- Banking crisis measures: Caprio and Klingebiel (2003); Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999)
- Civil war measures: Sarkees (2000) Correlates of War Intra-State War Data, 1816-1997
- Quality of government: Polity International IV dataset


**Specifications**

1. Crisis is contemporaneously exogenous to output growth, no feedback from previous output to a crisis

$$ g_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1}^{4}\beta_j g_{i,t-j} + \sum_{s=0}^{4}\delta_s D_{i,t-s} +\epsilon_{it} \tag{1} $$

2. Output growth is contemporaneously exogenous to the crisis, and crisis has only a lagged effect on output ($\delta_0=0$)

$$ g_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1}^{4}\beta_j g_{i,t-j} + \sum_{s=1}^{4}\delta_s D_{i,t-s} +\epsilon_{it} \tag{2}$$

3. Crisis is contemporaneously exogenous to output growth, and allow feedback from previous output growth to the current probability of a crisis.
In addition to Equation (1), there is 

$$ Pr(D_{it}=1) = F(\mu + \sum_{j=1}^{4}\gamma_j g_{i,t-j} + \sum_{s=1}^{4}\phi_s D_{i,t-s} + \nu_{it}) \tag{3}$$

**Impulse responses**

The impulse response of output to each type of shock estimated with Specification (1), 
annual observations from 190 countries from 1960 to 2001.
