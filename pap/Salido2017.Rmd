**Key idea**: credit-market sentiment (proxied by credit spread) predicts real 
economic fluctuations. 

#### Theories of the credit cycle

**Theories based on financial frictions**

Given frictions in the debt market, there exists positive feedback between 
net worth and borrowing constraints that generate credit cycles. 

*There are externalities in leverage choice: Individual agents do not fully 
internalize the vulnerabilities that their own borrowing decisions impose on 
the aggregate economy, and so they overborrow from the perspective of a social 
planner. Therefore, leverage as a state variable captures the fragility of 
the economy. 

**Behavioral theories**

The psychological model of belief formation is inherently extrapolative, 
which leads to overoptimism that only waits to be disappointed later on. 

**Integrated view**

Theories based on financial frictions explain the propagation and amplification 
of credit cycles, but do not endogenously explain what triggers a downturn nor 
the duration of the cycle. While behavioral theories provide an endogenous 
explanation of reversion of the cycle. 

#### Measuring credit-market sentiment

Credit spreads: long-term Baa-rated bonds yields - Treasury security yields

Junk-bond share: share of junk bond issuance to total issuance

Excess bond premium (EBP): a measure of credit spreads net of default risk

Measuring stock-market sentiment: Shiller's cyclically adjusted PE ratio


#### Financial-market sentiment and economic activity

**Simple OLS** 

\[
\begin{array}{llll}
\Delta y_t = & \beta_1\Delta s_{t-1} + & \beta_2 r_{t-1}^{SP} + & \mathbf{\gamma' x_{t-1}} + \epsilon_t\\
             & -2.061^{**}             & 0.029  
\end{array}
\]

Alternative interpretations:

1. Forward-looking credit spreads and stock prices anticipate economic changes.
2. Past sentiment unwinds and reverses itself, which leads to tightened credit 
   and reduced economic activities.
   
**2SLS method**

1. Forecast credit spread change ($\Delta s_t$) with past high-yield share
($\text{HYS}_{t-2}$) and credit spread ($s_{t-2}$). 
2. Forecast change in economic variables ($\Delta y_{t+h}$) with estimated
$\Delta\hat s_t$.

The 2SLS estimates the impact on economic activity of the component of credit-
spread changes driven by a reversal of prior sentiment. 

\[
\begin{array}{llll}
\Delta\hat s_t = & \theta_1 s_{t-2}  &+ \theta_2\ln\text{HYS}_{t-2} &+ u_t \\
                 & 0.095^{***}       & -0.248^{***}    \\
\hat r^{SP}_t = & \theta_3 \ln(P/E10)_{t-2} & &+ v_t \\
                & -0.134^{***}   \\
\end{array}
\tag{1}
\]

\[
\begin{array}{llll}
\Delta y_{t+h} = & \beta_1\Delta\hat s_{t-1} + & \beta_2\hat r_{t-1}^{SP} + & \mathbf{\gamma' x_{t-1}} +\epsilon_t  \\
                 & -4.800^{***}                & 0.069 
\end{array}
\tag{2}
\]

There is a clear separation between sentiment in the credit market and sentiment
in the stock market: any forecasting power the stock market has for the real 
economy arises primarily from its role as a passive predictor, rather than from 
any causal impact of stock-market sentiment.


**Outliers and subsample stability**

Checking with a rolling sample with a 40-year window, the Great Depression
significantly drives down the estimates; the estimates have been remarkably 
stable in the postwar period.

**Different horizons and measures of economic activity**

Extend forecast horizons for $h=1,2$. 
Other dependent variables: business fixed investment, residential investment, 
durable goods consumption, unemployment rate, etc. 
All report negative coefficients. 

**Additional indicators of credit-market sentiment**

Forecast $\Delta\hat s_t$ with the level of term spread, excess bond premium
(EBP). The results are robust. 

**Asymmetries: overheating versus overcooling**

Allow for different coefficients on credit-spread increases ($\Delta s^{(+)}_{t-1}$) 
and decreases ($\Delta s^{(-)}_{t-1}$).
The magnitude of the contraction following an increase in credit-spread is 
larger than the magnitude of the boom following a decrease in credit-spread. 
But the estimates are not robust. 

**Comparison with balance-sheet measures of leverage**

Include $\Delta\hat s_t$ together with five-year change of bank credit,
bank loans, private nonfinancial credit to GDP, nonfinancial business credit
to GDP, household credit to GDP, debt to asset ratio for nonfinancial corporate
sector.
Credit-market sentiment holds up well in competition with the balance sheet 
variables.

*The half-life of credit=market sentiment (<2 years) is much shorter than 
balance-sheet variables (4-7.5 years). The short data range might not well 
capture the effect of balance-sheet variables.

**Interactive effects**

The vulnerabilities-plus-triggers framework suggests an interactive specification.
Interact credit-market sentiment with balance-sheet measures. 
The impact of $\Delta\hat s_t$ is stronger in magnitude when leverage is high. 

#### Exploring the mechanism

1. Overoptimistic sentiment tends to reverse itself, which leads to a widening 
   of credit spread and a reduction in credit supply. 
2. Overoptimism leads to overinvestment in some sectors, which makes the economy
   vulnerable to a downturn (in this case credit demand shrinks). 
   
**Evidence from the corporate financing mix**

If sentiment-reversion reduces the credit supply, we would observe a reduction
in debt issuance but an increase in equity issuance. 
It is unlikely overinvestment would lead to a change in corporate financing mix.
The evidence confirms this: a forecasted widening of credit spread is associated
with a subsequent decrease in debt issuance and an increase in equity issuance.

**Investment behavior of firms by rating category**

The credit supply channel will affect the capital expenditure of firms with 
lower credit ratings more than the firms with higher ratings. 
This is also consistent with the findings.
