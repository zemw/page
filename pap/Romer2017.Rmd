**New series**

A new measure of financial distress based on narrative accounts of country 
conditions in the OECD *Economic Outlook* (1967-2012, 24 countries).
Coding the severity of financial distress:

1. Credit disruptions: strains in financial markets
2. Minor crisis: significant problems in the financial sector
3. Moderate crisis: problems are widespread and severe
4. Major and extreme financial crisis: large impediments to financial intermediation

Each category is sub-divided into "regular", "minus", and "plus".


**The average aftermath**

$$
y_{j,t+i} = 
\alpha_j^i + \gamma_t^i + \beta^i F_{j,t} + 
\sum_{k=1}^4 \phi_k^i F_{j,t-k} + 
\sum_{k=1}^4 \theta_k^i y_{j,t-k} + 
e_{j,t}^i
$$

where $j$ index countries, $t$ index time, $i=0...10$ denote horizon.
$F_{j,t}$ is the financial distress measure.
Assume economic activity is affected by financial distress contemporaneously,
but distress is not affect by economic activity contemporaneously.

Impulse response result:

- Average GDP decline 5 percent
- Average industrial production decline 2 percent
- Average unemployment rise 2 percent

The average aftermath of a financial crisis is medium-sized, bad but nor terrible.

Robustness checks:

- Compare with results using alternative chronologies
- Feasible GLS: used OLS residuals as weighting matrix
- Alternative treatment of contemporaneous correlation


**Variation in the aftermath of crisis**

Outliers and sensitivity:

- Most extreme observations come from smaller or less advanced economies
- The GDP decline after a crisis in the pre-2007 period is decidedly smaller
- Excluding individual countries may alter the result significantly

Depth and heterogeneity in key episodes:

$$
y_{j,t+i} = 
\alpha_j^i + \gamma_t^i + \beta^i F_{j,t} + 
\left(\sum_{k=-4}^{i} \phi_k^i F_{j,t+k}\right) + 
\sum_{k=1}^4 \theta_k^i y_{j,t-k} + 
e_{j,t}^i
$$

- Forecast GDP using only past values in episodes of distress, calculate
  forecasting error with regard to actual GDP: there are tremendous variation
  in the forecasting errors. More often the aftermath is mild, but sometimes
  horrific.
- Including the severity of distress in the forecasting: the more severe
  the distress, the worse the outcome. This accounts for half of the 
  heterogeneity.
- Nonlinearity of distress effect: replace $F$ with $f(F)=F+bF^2$.
  The results are very similar to linear models.
