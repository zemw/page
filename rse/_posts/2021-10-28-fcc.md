# Financial Cycles in China

**Abstract**

This paper is a comprehensive study of the financial cycles in China. By
adopting a trend-cycle approach, the study finds a short-term 2-3 year cycle in
major financial variables, whose turning points typically lead the turning
points of the real business cycle for 1-3 quarters. Different kinds of financial
shocks have heterogeneous effects on the macroeconomy. A credit shock boosts the
output gap as much as 0.6 percent and peaks in 4-6 quarters, while the impact of
increasing leverage is much more sustaining. House prices, which are more
sensitive to growth and interest rates, usually signal the turning points in
business cycle movements. Credit expansion fueled by high asset prices is a
particularly strong propulsion for output growth. However, it also presages more
severe downturns. The evidence is consistent with the financial accelerator
effect and the financial instability hypothesis.
