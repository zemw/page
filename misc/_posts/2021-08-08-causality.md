# Why Macroeconomists do not care about causal effect?

When I present time series studies to applied micro economists, one question 
that always haunts me is how can I identity the causal effect?
Since economic variables are always interdependent, without random assignment,
how do I know it is the effect of variable X but not Y?
Without causality, the study identifies nothing. 
So what is the value of such kind of research?
I felt embarrassing each time I was asked this question. 
I could only fob it off with something like: 
because they are different kinds of studies.

But I know that's not the answer. The question makes perfect sense. 
But it is just not the interest of most time series studies. 
I am here to give you a good reason for that excuse. 

**Micro and macro**

For most economists, causal effect means the difference between the treated 
and untreated outcomes provided everything else equal. 
With cross-sectional data, identification of causal effect usually entails
large scale randomization. For example, to identify the effect of a vaccine,
the research would involve a large number of participants. Some of them are 
randomly selected to be vaccined; others receive placebo treatment. 
So there is no different on average between the treatment and the control 
groups except the treatment -- vaccination. 
In such setting, the different outcome between the two groups must be attributed 
to the causal effect of the vaccination. 

If we apply this concept of causality to a macroeconomic problem: suppose we want
to figure out what is the consequence of raising interest rate by 1 percent, this 
would require that we conduct an experiment where there is a large number of 
countries, each conducting independent monetary policy. At some time, 
some of these countries randomly decide to raise the interest rates. 
And the countries that raise the interest rates need to be on average the same 
as those that do not raise the interest rates. 
Therefore, by comparing the economic outcomes of the two groups, we are able 
to identify the consequence of raising interest rate by 1 percent. 

However, without further explanation, such an experiment is not feasible 
in the real world.
Yet we are still interested in figure out the effect of rising interest rate. 
What can we do? Stock and Watson come up with a work-around, they call it 
"dynamic causal effect". 

> In time series data it is useful to think of a randomized controlled experiment 
as consisting of the same subject (e.g., the U.S. economy) being given different 
treatments (randomly chosen changes in interest rates) at different points in time 
(the 1970s, the 1980s, and so forth). In this framework, the single subject at 
different times plays the role of both treatment and control group: Sometimes the 
Fed changes the interest rate, while at other times it does not. Because data are 
collected over time, it is possible to estimate the dynamic causal effectâ€”that is, 
the time path of the effect on the outcome of interest of the treatment.


But this does not solve the "endogeneity" problem. Suppose we observe a slowdown 
of GDP growth following an interest rate hike, how do we know it is the "causal" 
effect of the interest rate, not other economic variables? Maybe there are variables
working behind the scene that affect both interest rate and GDP growth. 
Even if we could isolate unexpected policy shock (interest rate shocks orthogonal 
to economic fundamentals), how do we know there is no missing variables? 
Maybe there are other sources of causes that bring about the same outcome. 
Therefore, "dynamic causal effect" is not the escape. 
Our essential question remains unsolved. 

**Two types of causality**

Maybe we should ponder for a while and ask ourselves what we really want. 
Human beings always try to ask why. We want to figure out the reason behind 
things, not just acknowledge the fact. 
The causes are important, because once we know it, we know how to exert effort
to make a difference. 
Once we know some kind of bacteria cause the disease, we know that we can cure 
the disease by killing the bacteria. 
In this sense, causality means the chain of cause and effect that enable us 
to reproduce the outcome that we desire. 

Note that the causality defined by *ceteris paribus*, as in the case of randomized 
experiment, is not the same as the causality defined by reproducibility. 
In some applications, the two types of causality overlap, such as testing a vaccine 
by randomized experiment, in which tested effectiveness can be trusted to reproduce 
the desirable outcome. 
But in some applications, the two types of causality mean completely different things. 
For example, a randomized experiment may report one more year education increases 
students' job market income by 7 percent. Even if the experiment is perfectly random, 
we cannot rely on the result to make decisions: tell your kids to get more education 
does not guarantee them better income in the future. The decisions, of course, 
have to be made case by case, depending on personal characters.
In such applications, the results from the randomized experiments have little value
in practice, since it does not tell the nature of education nor any insight to 
a successful career.
The results only tell what things look like on average in a very narrow sense.
The average outcomes may or may not be able to generalize across space and time. 
For example, the average reward for one more year education could be very different
giving different economic settings, across different countries, in different times.

To briefly summarize, the causality in the statistical sense is not the same as 
the true cause and effect that can be utilized to reproduce desirable result.
However, the most valuable causality is the latter one, since human progress is 
essentially about how to make a difference by utilizing human knowledge. 
And the key to the reproducibility of a causal finding is how generalizable they are.
The results from a randomized experiment, no matter how rigorous they are,
if not generalizable, provide little value in real practice. 
It is no more than an exquisite description of a tiny piece of historical event.

**Towards generalizable theories**

Now we are ready for the central idea of this thesis. I would propose the following 
claim: any generalizable theory about cause and effect cannot be obtained by purely 
empirical studies. That is, no empirical study or experiment, no matter how well
they are designed, could serve the purpose to identify the nature of things 
(the generalizable and reproducible chain of cause and effect); 
though they could be used to falsify a theory if properly designed.

A proof of the claim would be obscure and unnecessary. 
A few examples are sufficient to illustrate my point. 

A randomized experiment may test the effectiveness of a vaccine. But we would never 
trust the vaccine unless we understand the underlying mechanism -- how vaccines 
stimulate the body's immune response to produce antibodies. 
The cause and effect of a vaccine are established, firstly by understanding the 
theories of how vaccine could possibly work, and secondly by subjecting this 
understanding to a rigorous test. 
Theories are human device based on facts, but are not equivalent to facts;
they are generalizable statement about how things could possibly work. 
Theories can never be fully proved by experiments because that would require 
infinite number of tests in all possible occasions. However,
experiments can falsify theories if theories do not predict the results consistent 
with empirical facts. 
Needless to say, human progress is about discovering new theories and mechanism
(e.g. mRNA could stimulate immune response). 
Experiments or empirical studies are indispensable part of the research but they 
themselves do not contribute to human understanding of the nature of the problem.

As a second example, 
the empirical study that finds one more year education increases job market income
by 7% tells no more than the fact itself.
No valuable advice could be given to young people or their educators simply based 
on this result unless we understand how education shapes personal life and 
what kind of education one needs for successful career. 
A good educator is able to nurture talents reproducibly, not because he has 
knowledge of the empirical result, but because he understands how education works. 
The empirical study only makes sense in so far as statistical concerns.
It is not the causality that we value the most which reveal the nature of things.
However, if rigorous study finds education has no effect on future career success,
it would suggest a reexamination of relevant theories regarding education and 
career development.


These two examples should make my point clear. 
The generalizable knowledge of cause and effect, regarding the mechanism of 
how things work, which can be utilized to produce desirable results, typically
require a higher level of understanding and theorization, not directly obtained
from empirical facts.

In the light of the above discussion, the difference between cross-section and 
time series methods, or micro and macro empirical studies, are largely misleading. 
It is misleading to believe the rigorously designed micro empirical studies
identify causal effect while the loosely time series studies provide only 
correlation. 
Neither of them reveals the true causal chain, in the sense of generalizable 
statement on how things work. Neither of them guarantees reproducibility.
Neither of them can be directly utilized to make a difference. 
Both of them show the facts discovered in the data. Both of them need to 
be supplemented by a higher level of theories to uncover the true causal chain.
The real difference between the two is, by rigorously designed experiment, 
micro studies give more accurate fact, free of confounding factors or omitted 
variable bias. Whereas most empirical macro studies are unable to do so. 
In other words, micro studies dig the data more carefully and rigorously.
But accurate identification of a variance-inducing factor does not mean 
understanding of how things work.

**Why macroeconomists do not care about causal effect**

Economics, like any other disciplines, is interested in understanding the 
cause and nature of certain subjects of interest. 
Just like medical researchers are interested in figuring out the cause 
of certain disease and how to prevent it, we economists are interested 
in things like how economic crises happen and how to prevent it. 
To answer these questions, various theories have been developed by the
great intellectuals in history. 
Sometimes different theories provide contradictory explanations. 
For example, Classical School and Keynesian School give different 
explanations regarding the cause of economic crises. 
The job of empirical studies is to provide evidence to support which theory 
is more appropriate. 
Due to the complex nature of economic problems, empirical evidence
neither verify nor falsify a theory. It only serves as an unrigorous
test of consistency. 


It is true that time series studies do not provide the same level of accuracy 
as randomized cross-sectional studies. 
It is also true that without random assignment, we are not free of confounders
or missing variables. The correlation between ice cream sales and economic
growth may be equally strong as the correlation between money and inflation.
And there might be a common factor such as cosmic microwave that affects
all microeconomic variables behind the scene.
But we are not interested in including ice cream or cosmic microwave in
our equations, simply because they are not the major concern of economic 
studies, and no economic theory will hypothesize on that direction.
We are more interested in working in the framework of economic theories
than drilling down to the exact factor that induce the difference.

It would be wrong or even dangerous to mistake the "causal effect" 
identified by randomized experiment, which is a variance-inducing factor
precisely speaking, as the true causality that can be generalized and 
applied to real applications.
It would be dull to advise one that wants higher income to finish a PhD 
based on the empirical results that more education leads to higher income.
It would be equally unwise to advice the government that lower interest rate 
will always bring about higher growth, 
even if we can set up an experiment and rigorously test out that lower 
interest rate leads to higher GDP growth.
Such advice can never be made purely based on empirical findings without
a proper understanding of the nature of economic growth and interest 
rate and the various mechanisms that link them together.
In this concern, digging the data to the bottom to find the exact causal 
factor does not seem rewarding given the required amount of work.
It is more reasonable to simply acknowledge the historical correlation 
between interest rate and GDP growth, and leave the rest to theoretical
debates.

In a nutshell, why empirical macroeconomists are not as enthusiastic about 
rigorous identification as microeconomists do? Because most of the time,
it is not feasible, nor does it give us what we want. 
We should always keep in mind identifying a cause statistically, which is 
identifying an effective variance-inducing factor, is not same as 
understanding the mechanism of how things work.
A generalizable statement regarding the cause and effect that can be 
utilized to reproduce certain result cannot be directly obtained from 
empirical results but only through theoretical reflections.
