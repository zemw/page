# Some thoughts on wealth tax

It is well-known that a federal tax on wealth is one of the pillars of Democratic candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign. Sen. Warren proposed to tax 2 percent of the assets above  $50m and an additional 1 percent on assets above $1bn. As an example given by Financial Times, "Mr Gates is worth  $107bn, according to Forbes. Sen. Warren's Campaign says he would pay $6.4bn next year."

The question is what's the consequence of a wealth tax? Is it to even wealth distribution? Is it discouraging capital accumulation? There are plenty of studies trying to answer these questions. The New York Times even estimated that Sen. Warren's tax plan would reduce America's economic growth by 0.2 percent a year.

But none of these studies, which seems to me, debates about the economic essence of wealth tax. An income tax is essentially a redistribution of the output of an economy from somebody's hands to others. But a wealth tax, by no means, is simply a redistribution of wealth. Wealth does not directly correspond to any real output of the time, but it is barely an "estimate" of future income streams. If a tax is levied on wealth, it is equivalently saying a tax is levied on future incomes. That makes a wealth tax really quirky.

For billionaires like Bill Gates, an annually $6.4bn tax is surely way beyond his available cash. In order to pay the tax, Mr Gates probably has to liquidate his assets every year. Therefore, the possible consequences are: 1. Asset prices are sure to fall; 2. More money needs to be printed to facilitate this process; 3. Inflation is likely to follow.

Let me expain this with a few balance sheet tricks. It is well known that when investments are financed indirectly by depository institutions like banks, new money is created as deposits. And when the investments are finalized as equity holdings, money circulates back to banks and eventually get written off ("initial financing" vs "final financing" in the words of monetary circuit theory). 

A tax on wealth is like the reverse of the process. Suppose Bill Gates pays his $6.4bn wealth tax by selling his Microsoft shares; suppose a bank acquires these shares and credits Mr Gates' personal deposit account with $6.4bn cash (Step 1). Mr Gates then pays his tax by sending the money to the government's account (Step 2). The government spends the money, let's say, to finance infrastructure building. Therefore, the money is then paid to contruction workers' account (Step 3). The result is not much different than printing the $6.4bn out of thin air, but backed up by equivalent value of Microsoft shares. 

| Assets      | Liabilities         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
|（1）shares   | (1) Gates +$6.4bn   |
|             | (2) Gates -$6.4bn   |
|             | (2) Gov +$6.4bn     |
|             | (3) Gov -$6.4bn     |
|             | (3) Workers +$6.4bn |


Sen. Warren proposed the wealth tax would be used to finance universal childcare, education, student loan forgiveness, and infrastructure. But, since wealth is the "present value" of future income streams, a wealth tax is not actually paid by any current output of the economy, but by a claim to future output — i.e. credit. The economy consequence of "finance by wealth tax" would be the same as finance these projects by simply printing money.

Inflation is likely to follow. These projects are said to be financed by the tax from the wealth, but, in fact, they are financed by the whole population (through "inflation tax"s, because the real output promised by those wealth is not materialised at the moment). Besides, this may be a counterproductive use of resources. As argued by Adam Smith two-hundreds years ago, taxes used to finance government (non-productive) spending eat into the national capital and reduces the potential output capability. Just like Bill Gates and some other billionaires have pointed out, it would be a better use of their wealth to finance innovative startups or charities.

But it would be also wrong to say that there is no merit in a wealth tax at all. It would surely reduce asset prices, which makes assets more affordable. It would also reduce wealth concentration — capitalists are encouraged to liquidate their assets above a threshold to avoid more tax. In terms of reducing wealth inequality, a wealth tax would certainly play a role.
