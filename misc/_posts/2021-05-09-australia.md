# Why you still want to study in Australia?

A decision to study abroad is momentous for everyone at thier study age. Travelling long way from home and embracing a freshing different culture could be an inspiring and life-changing experience. 

However, nothing is more disappointed, for a young adult, who just celebrated on an offer from a foreign university, than being told his or her travel to the destination country is suspended indefinitely. 

For those international student who were to commence their study in 2020, life is unfair. When the world is trembling to control the spread of the virus, countries keep their eye on themselves, shut the borders, suspend the travel. Those international students, who were promised a life-changing experience in a foreign country, were foced to stay at home and study over some online meeting apps. 

A year has passed. 

In the February of 2021, a petition to the Australian parliment was filed, by some desperate international students who were admitted by Asutralian universities but was blocked by the government's travel ban for over a year, for exemption to return. 17,317 people signed the petition. However, they got nothing but a response of empty words with no further actions. 

As the vaccine roll out, the US has announced to reopen its border for international students in August this year. While the UK has lifted restrictions as early as January, international students has already been sitting in their classroom for this spring semester. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has just revealed Australia border will remain closed indefinitely. No further message to the international students. No clarification. No timeline. No tuition fee discount. What they got is absolute neglect and silence treamtent from the Australian goverment. 

These are enough to reveal Australia government's attitude toward international students. Here is message: You are trivial. Do not come back. We do not care about your education or your future. You are our source of revenue but nothing else. 

Least should these worlds be used to portrait a nation's education sector - the backbone of a nation's spirit, the essential body to pass on knowledge and nurture humanity. A higher quality education that attracts students worldwide is not just a matter of showiness or profits, but more importantly, a matter of international reputation, an image of a nation's spirituality. There is no doubt that the actions taken by Australian government towards international students fails the standard of a high-starndard education provider, not just materially, but morally. 

Julian Hill, MP in the House of Representitive, lashed out at the Morrison government during a parliment debate early this year, for PM's complete lack of care for international students.

> Australians are a better people than we’ve been represented by our prime minister, who has not shown any care, any empathy, any recognition of the plight that you suffered, the destitution that students have faced, saying potentially life savings that their families threatened, being chucked out of work, being unable to pay their rent.

> They are literally starving and relying on food vouchers, and not one word of care from the prime minister… that embarrassed me and I was ashamed as an Australian at his lack of care.

> International students deserved a lot better than they’ve had from this mean, miserable government, and it does not represent the views of Australians. You are welcome here. And we look forward to the day where students are able to come back onshore and study in our communities.

The Morrison government certainly does not represents the whole of Australians. Mr Hill is among those empathetic Australians. But the Morrison government does show the world another face of this country. Beneath the bright side of Australian values - freedom, respect, compassion and equility, there is another side, the dark side of this nation - selfish, egocentric, xenophobic, and unsympathetic. 

If the government's attitude toward the international students let people question this government's moral worth, then the outrageous decision to punish its own citizens to prison if they return home from india after a surge in COVID cases make this government a moral pariah. This government not only lacks empathy and compassion, but does not even understand the basic principle of citizenship and humanity. 

Now this decision has been withdrawn under almost universal condemnation. But it would take much longer time, if possible, to retore the reputation of Australian education sector, as well as the image of this nation among international students.
